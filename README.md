## Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry, leading to substantial financial losses for both individuals and organizations. Anomaly detection techniques can help detect unusual patterns or behaviors in credit card transactions that may indicate fraud.

In this project, we implement anomaly detection algorithms, such as Isolation Forest or Local Outlier Factor, to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. These algorithms can detect anomalies in the transaction data based on features like transaction amount, time, and other relevant variables.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. It contains a large number of anonymized credit card transactions, including both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The dataset provides features like transaction amount, time, and PCA-transformed features to maintain confidentiality.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:<br>`cd credit-card-fraud-detection`

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:<br>`pip install -r requirements.txt`



## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook `Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb` in your preferred environment.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to run the code step-by-step.
3. Explore different anomaly detection algorithms and experiment with the dataset.
4. Evaluate the performance of the models and analyze the results.

## Results
The results of the credit card fraud detection system will be presented in the notebook. You can find the evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the performance of the implemented anomaly detection algorithms.
